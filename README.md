# Web-Scrapping

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites using software programs or algorithms. This data can be in the form of text, images, videos, or any other format available on the website. Web scraping tools can be programmed to visit different web pages, collect specific data based on certain criteria, and store the information in a structured format like a database or spreadsheet.

Web scraping has a wide range of applications, such as market research, price comparison, and content aggregation. However, it's important to note that web scraping may be illegal or unethical if it violates a website's terms of service or infringes on the owner's intellectual property rights.

# Data collection using API

Data collection using API involves retrieving data from a website or web application through an Application Programming Interface (API). An API is a set of protocols, routines, and tools that enable different software applications to communicate with each other.

APIs provide a structured way to access data from web services, such as social media platforms, e-commerce websites, or weather APIs, and retrieve specific information like user profiles, product details, or weather forecasts. The API acts as an intermediary between the data source and the software application, allowing developers to request data, specify parameters, and receive data in a structured format, such as JSON or XML.

Data collection using API is a popular method for businesses and organizations that require large amounts of data for analysis or decision-making. It's also a more efficient and reliable method compared to web scraping, as it doesn't violate website terms of service and provides a more standardized and structured way to access data.
