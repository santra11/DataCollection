# WebScrapping

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites using software programs or algorithms. This data can be in the form of text, images, videos, or any other format available on the website. Web scraping tools can be programmed to visit different web pages, collect specific data based on certain criteria, and store the information in a structured format like a database or spreadsheet.

Web scraping has a wide range of applications, such as market research, price comparison, and content aggregation. However, it's important to note that web scraping may be illegal or unethical if it violates a website's terms of service or infringes on the owner's intellectual property rights.
